# ConstraintSolver

Just a repo in which I try to work my way through constraint solvers with tests.
Starting out super duper basic, and probably failing or losing interest before I
get anywhere interesting.  In other words: nothing to see here, move along (most
likely)

## Reading

If you want to follow along with my reading list, I'm starting out here:
